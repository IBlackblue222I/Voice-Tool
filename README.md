# Voice-Tool
A (Linux) tool letting you execute actions on your computer using voice. Powered by Vosk. Fully local.

As of now the software is developped on a Zorin OS system and should be usable on Ubuntu systems. Other systems are a mystery
The tool uses a local Vosk model (roughly 40Mb, other versions of 1Gb and more exist) to handle speech recognition and matches each command with a .json containing the actions linked to words. This means by modifying the .json file, it should be possible to add more commands.

Heavily work-in-progress, developpement started janv. 2026 and may improve or not solely depending on my will to pursue this side project.
